    "\n",
    "1. **SyntaxError**: Raised when there's a syntax error in your code.\n",
    "2. **IndentationError**: Raised when there's an issue with the indentation of your code.\n",
    "3. **NameError**: Raised when a local or global name is not found.\n",
    "4. **TypeError**: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.\n",
    "5. **ValueError**: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct data type but an inappropriate value.\n",
    "6. **KeyError**: Raised when a dictionary is accessed with a key that doesn't exist.\n",
    "7. **IndexError**: Raised when you try to access an element of a sequence (list, tuple, etc.) using an index that is out of range.\n",
    "8. **FileNotFoundError**: Raised when an attempt to open a file fails because the file does not exist.\n",
    "9. **IOError**: Raised for input/output errors, such as when reading or writing to a file.\n",
    "10. **ZeroDivisionError**: Raised when dividing by zero.\n",
    "11. **AttributeError**: Raised when trying to access an attribute that does not exist.\n",
    "12. **ImportError**: Raised when an imported module or package is not found or there is an issue with the import statement.\n",
    "13. **ModuleNotFoundError**: A specific type of ImportError, raised when a module is not found.\n",
    "14. **NotImplementedError**: Raised when an abstract method in an abstract base class is not implemented by a concrete subclass.\n",
    "15. **MemoryError**: Raised when the program runs out of memory.\n",
    "16. **RecursionError**: Raised when the maximum recursion depth is exceeded.\n",
    "17. **KeyboardInterrupt**: Raised when the user interrupts the program (e.g., pressing Ctrl+C).\n",
    "18. **AssertionError**: Raised when an assert statement fails.\n",
    "19. **SystemExit**: Raised when the sys.exit() function is called.\n",
    "20. **ArithmeticError**: A base class for numeric errors, including ZeroDivisionError and OverflowError.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just some of the common exceptions you might encounter while writing Python code. It's important to handle these exceptions appropriately to make your code more robust and user-friendly. You can use try and except blocks to catch and handle these exceptions in your code, as explained in the previous answer."
