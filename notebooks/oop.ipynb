    "## Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "In object oriented programming (**OOP**), abstraction is one of the fundamental principles. **Abstraction** involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential **properties and behaviors** they share, while hiding the unnecessary details. It is a way of managing complexity by focusing on the relevant aspects of an object and ignoring the irrelevant ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of abstraction in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Abstraction**:\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: This is the process of bundling the data (**attributes or properties**) and the methods (**functions or procedures**) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a **class**. Encapsulation **hides the internal details** of an object and **restricts direct access to some of its components**, allowing the object to **control its state and behavior**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Hiding**: Encapsulation also involves the concept of **data hiding**, where the internal details of an object are hidden from the outside world. Access to the internal data is controlled through **public and private access modifiers**, ensuring that only the necessary information is exposed to the external environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Behavioral Abstraction**:\n",
    "- **Inheritance**: This is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass or base class). Inheritance **promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes**, with the subclass inheriting the characteristics of the superclass. It enables the creation of a hierarchy of classes, making it easier to understand and manage the relationships between different objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polymorphism**: This allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. Polymorphism enables a single interface to represent different types of objects, providing flexibility and extensibility. There are **two types of polymorphism**: compile-time (**method overloading**) and runtime (**method overriding**)."

    "In Python, polymorphism is achieved through a combination of **dynamic typing**, **duck typing**, and **method overriding**. Here's how polymorphism works in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Duck Typing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is **dynamically typed**, meaning the type of an object is **determined at runtime**.\n",

    "- In Python, polymorphism is often achieved **through method overriding**, where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "- It enables method overriding and dynamic method binding, which means that the **method called is determined at runtime**.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Loose coupling promotes **flexibility**, **maintainability**, and **reusability**.\n",
    "- Achieved through the use of **interfaces**, **abstract classes**, and **dependency injection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tight Coupling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a tightly coupled system, **classes or modules are highly dependent** on each other.\n",
    "- Changes in one class may require modifications in other classes, leading to a higher risk of errors and **increased difficulty in maintenance**.\n",
    "- Tight coupling can **make the system less flexible** and **harder to understand**.\n",
    "- It is generally **discouraged** in object-oriented design.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ways to Achieve Loose Coupling**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Abstraction**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **interfaces** and **abstract classes** to define a common interface **without exposing the details of the implementation**.\n",
    "- Clients **depend on abstractions** rather than concrete classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dependency Injection**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of creating dependencies within a class, **inject them from the outside**. This makes the class more flexible and easier to test.\n",
    "- Dependency injection frameworks can help manage dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Event Handling**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use events and listeners to decouple components. **One component can notify others about changes without them needing to know each other**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Service Locator and Dependency Inversion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement a service locator or use dependency inversion to **invert the flow of control** and reduce direct dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Design Patterns**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply design patterns like the **Observer pattern**, **Strategy pattern**, and **Adapter pattern** to achieve loose coupling."
