    "## How to stack decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can stack multiple decorators on a single function to apply multiple transformations or behaviors to that function. Stacking decorators is a way to modularize and extend the functionality of your functions. The order in which you stack decorators matters because decorators are applied from the innermost to the outermost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how to stack decorators in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define your decorators: Create multiple decorator functions, each with its own behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Apply the decorators to a function: Stack the decorators on top of a function by placing them one above the other using the @ symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Call the decorated function: When you call the decorated function, the decorators are applied in the order they were stacked."
