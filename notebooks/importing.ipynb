    "## Issues with Importing Everything from a Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing everything from a module using a wildcard import (e.g., from module import *) can lead to several issues and is generally discouraged. While it may seem convenient, it can make your code less readable, harder to maintain, and more error-prone. Here are some of the issues with importing everything from a module:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Namespace Pollution**: When you import everything from a module, all its functions, classes, and variables become available in your current namespace. This can lead to name conflicts if two modules have functions or variables with the same name. It becomes challenging to determine where a specific function or variable originated from, making the code less clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Readability**: It can be difficult to understand the origin of functions and variables when you're not explicitly specifying the module they come from. This can make your code less readable and more challenging to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Code Maintenance**: Wildcard imports make it difficult to track dependencies in your code. When you review or maintain your code in the future, it can be unclear which functions or variables are used, where they come from, and whether they are still needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Performance**: Importing everything from a module can impact performance. The module may contain a large number of functions and classes, and importing everything may consume unnecessary memory and slow down your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Code Conflicts**: Some modules may define functions or variables that have common names, like open or name. Importing everything can lead to unintentional shadowing of built-in functions or variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Security Risks**: Wildcard imports can potentially introduce security risks if you're importing functions that execute malicious code or override standard library functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these issues, it's generally recommended to import specific functions, classes, or variables that you need from a module, or use aliasing to make the code more readable without importing everything."
