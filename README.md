Learn Python Programming, my attempt to make it quick and easy for you to learn the essentials of Python. There are many other things to know about Python that I didn't cover in this repo.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Poetry 1.6

## How to use

Please read and execute each step below:

### Step 1

Install poetry by script:
```bash
$promt> bash install-poetry.sh
```

### Step 2

Activating the virtual environment:

```bash
$promt> poetry shell
```

### Optional

Deactivate the virtual environment and exit:

```bash
$(learn-python-py3.12)> exit
# To deactivate the virtual environment without leaving the shell use deactivate
$(learn-python-py3.12)> deactivate
```
