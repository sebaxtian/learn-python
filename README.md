Learn Python Programming, my attempt to make it quick and easy for you to learn the essentials of Python. There are many other things to know about Python that I didn't cover in this repo.

## How to use

Please read and execute each step below:

### Step 1

Create and use Python virtual environment:

```bash
$promt> python -m venv .venv
$promt> source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 2

Install all Python requirements:

```bash
$promt> python -m pip install -U pip
$promt> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Optional

Generate a requirements file and then install from it in another environment:

```bash
$promt> pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
